BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR 
USING THE WEBSITE OR APPLICATION (AQITA) OR THE SERVICE, YOU 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE 
TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS, INCLUDING THE 
PRIVACY POLICY. 
By accessing or using our Service, you agree to our terms and conditions. 
If you are not eligible or do not agree to all of the Terms, you should refrain 
from using our services. Also Aqita has the right to change the 
terms & conditions at any time. 
You acknowledge and agree to the following: 
●The website is licensed, not sold to you, and you may use the Service only as mentioned in the Terms 
●While creating an account on Aqita, we may ask for your mobile number in order to verify your account by a SMS (short-messaging-service) and any applicable SMS fees of your mobile network operator will apply.

●The Aqita Website does not provide any kind of warranties regarding the service. 
●Disputes arising hereunder will be resolved by binding arbitration
AND BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS, YOU AND AQITA
ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO

YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights 
under the Terms (except for matters that may be taken to small 
claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL 
ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be 
brought as a class action. Please review the Dispute Resolution and 
Arbitration provision below for the details regarding your agreement 
to arbitrate any disputes with Aqita. 
USE OF THE SERVICE 
Subject to the Terms (including without limitation your compliance with the 
Terms), you have the limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
non-sublicensable, revocable right to download and install a copy of the 
Application(s) from a legitimate marketplace (such as Apple’s App Store or Google 
Play) to your mobile device, and to access and use the Service, in each 
case, for your own personal use. You may not: (i) copy, modify, or create 
derivative works of the Service (or any part thereof) for any purpose; (ii) 
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, transfer, sell, sublicense, 
lease, lend, rent or otherwise make available the Service (or any part 
thereof) to any third party; (iii) decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble or 
interfere with or circumvent the Service (or any part thereof), including 
without limitation any security or access control mechanism (except to the 
extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law); or (iv) use 
the Service (or any part thereof) in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful 
purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with the Terms. 
Our Service may change from time to time and/or we may stop 
(permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or features within the 
Service), possibly without prior notice to you. Our Service may include 
advertisements, which may be targeted to the content or information on the 
Service, queries made through the Service, or from other information. The 
types and extent of advertising on the Service are also subject to change 
over time. In consideration for providing you the Service, you agree that we 
and our third party providers and partners may place advertising on our 
Service or in connection with the display of content or information on our 
Service. 
Certain features of our Service may be subject to additional terms or 
conditions, which will be posted with those features. Such terms and 
conditions are incorporated by reference into the Terms. 
In order to download the Application, you may be required by third parties who are 
providing services in connection with the Application, such as Apple, Inc. or 
Google (each, a “Service Provider”) to create an account. You are solely 
responsible for maintaining the security of any logins, passwords, or other 
credentials that you select or that are provided to you to access your 
account with any Service Provider. Your access and use of any account 
with a Service Provider, including without limitation in connection with the 
Service, is subject to any terms, conditions, and policies, including privacy 
policies, of that Service Provider. Aqita is not responsible for 
any act or omission of any Service Provider. Aqita does not 
provide you with the equipment to access or use the Service. You are 
responsible for all fees charged by third parties to access and use the 
Service (e.g., charges by Carriers). Without limiting the foregoing, you are 
solely responsible for the payment of all applicable fees associated with 
any Carrier service plan you use in connection with your access and use of 
the Service (such as voice, data, SMS, MMS, roaming, and other 
applicable fees charged by the Carrier). Accordingly, you should use care 
in selecting a service plan offered by your Carrier. If your device is lost or 
stolen, you must notify Aqita immediately to suspend services. 
CREATING AN ACCOUNT 
In order to access and use our Services, you may need to register and 
create an account (your “Account”). By creating an Account, you represent 
that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, have not previously 
been suspended or removed from the Service and are not a person barred 
from receiving the Service under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. 
When creating an Account, you may be required to provide your mobile 
number in order to verify your Account by text message. Please be aware 
that your Carrier’s text messaging fees apply for mobile number 
verification. When creating an Account, you also may be required to 
provide certain personal information about yourself and will establish a 
username and a password. We reserve the right to remove or reclaim a 
username if we believe it is appropriate. 
You agree to provide and maintain accurate, current and complete 
information about your Account, including without limitation your mobile 
phone number. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event you change or 
deactivate your mobile phone number, you will update your Account 
information promptly to ensure that your messages are not sent to the 
person who acquires your old number. 
When creating an Account, don’t: 
●Provide any false personal information to us (including without 
limitation a false username) or create any Account for anyone other 
than yourself without such other person’s permission; 
●Use a username that is the name of another person with the intent to 
impersonate that person; 
●Use a username that is subject to rights of another person without 
appropriate authorization; or 
●Use a username that is offensive, vulgar or obscene or otherwise in 
bad taste. 
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any 
information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to 
be inaccurate, false or misleading or to reclaim any username that you 
create through the Service that violates our Terms. You are responsible for 
maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Account, and agree to 
notify us if your password is lost, stolen, or disclosed to an unauthorized 
third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. You are responsible 
for activities that occur under your Account. If you have reason to believe 
that your Account (including without limitation your mobile phone) is no 
longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at support@aqita.in 
PAYMENT 
Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may require 
you to pay fees to a Service Provider. If you have any questions or issues 
with such payments, please contact the applicable Service Provider. 
PRIVACY POLICY 
Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use 
and disclose information from our users. The Privacy Policy is incorporated 
by reference into these Terms. 
CONTENT SUBMISSIONS 
Our Service allows you and other users to post, link, store, share and 
otherwise make available certain information, images, text and/or other 
content (“Content”). You are responsible for the Content that you make 
available to the Service, including without limitation its legality, reliability, 
and appropriateness. You retain any and all of your ownership rights to any 
Content you make available on or through the Service and you are 
responsible for protecting those rights. 
By making Content available on or through the Aqita Application, you 
grant us the perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free 
right and license (with the right to sublicense) to reproduce and distribute 
such Content to the intended recipient through the “Aqita” 
Website. 
You can remove Content that you posted by specifically deleting it. In 
certain instances, however, some Content (such as posts or comments you 
make) may not be completely removed on the Service and copies of your 
Content may continue to exist on the Service and/or elsewhere. We are not 
responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove 
or delete) any Content on the Service. 
You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) or you 
have the right to use it and to grant us the right and license granted in the 
Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does 
not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or 
any other rights of any person. 
We ask that you respect our on-line community and other users when 
posting Content and using the Service. You agree not to: 
●Submit material that violates a third party’s proprietary rights, 
including without limitation privacy and publicity rights, or that 
otherwise violates any applicable law; 
●Publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage us, our 
users or any third party; 
●Publish any private information of someone, like their address, phone 
number, email address, and similar information without their 
permission; 
●Submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, 
threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically 
offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal 
offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise 
inappropriate; 
●Post advertisements; 
●Impersonate another person or represent yourself as affiliated with 
us, our staff or other industry professionals, including without 
limitation by use of our trademarks, service marks, logos, branding or 
names without express written authorization from us; 
●Solicit a user’s password or other account information; or 
●Harvest user names, addresses, or email addresses for any purpose. 
This list is an example and is not intended to be complete or exclusive. We 
don’t have an obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Service or 
to review or edit any Content, but we have the right to do so for the purpose 
of operating the Service, to ensure your compliance with the Terms, or to 
comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, 
administrative agency or other governmental body. We reserve the right, at 
any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any 
Content that we consider, in our sole discretion, to be in violation of the 
Terms or otherwise harmful to the Service. 
Since the Service may not always be available and your Content on the 
Service may not always be available, you agree not to rely on the Service 
for the purposes of Content access, storage or backup. Aqita 
will not be liable to you for any modifications, suspension or discontinuation 
of the Service or the loss of any Content. 
CONTENT ON THE SERVICE 
The Content available through the Service has not been reviewed, verified 
or authenticated by us, and may include inaccuracies or false information 
or be offensive, indecent or objectionable. We make no representations, 
warranties, or guarantees in connection with our Service or any Content on 
the Service, including relating to the quality, suitability, truth, accuracy or 
completeness of any content contained in the Service. You acknowledge 
sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use or reliance 
of any Content. If notified by a user or content owner that Content allegedly 
does not conform to the Terms, we may investigate the allegation and 
determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the Content, which we 
reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. 
COPYRIGHT POLICY 
We do not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of 
intellectual property rights on the Service and will remove any such Content 
if properly notified that such Content infringes on another’s intellectual 
property rights. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe 
that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a 
notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by 
providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 
17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): 
●An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on 
behalf of the owner of the copyright’s interest; 
●A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been 
infringed; 
●A description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it 
is located on the Service; 
●Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Service 
where the material that you claim is infringing is located; 
●Your address, telephone number, and email address; 
●A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed 
use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; 
●A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above 
information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright 
owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. 
You can contact our Copyright Agent via email at support@aqita.in
Aqita will promptly terminate the Accounts of users that are 
determined by Aqita to be “repeat infringers.” A repeat 
infringer is a user who has repeatedly been notified of infringing activity 
and/or has had Content repeatedly removed from the Service.

agree that you will not do any of the following while using or accessing the 
Service: (i) attempt to access or search the Service or download Content

or third parties without their consent. We reserve the right to investigate 
and prosecute violations of any of the above and/or involve and cooperate 
with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate the 
Terms 
INDEMNITY 
You agree to indemnify and hold us and our officers, directors, employees, 
consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents harmless from and against 
any and all claims, costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including 
without limitation attorneys’ fees) we incur in relation to or arising from (i)

to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise

obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to 
cooperate with our defense of such claim. 
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES 
The Service may include links to other sites and services that are not 
operated by us. We are providing these links to you only as a convenience 
and are not responsible for the content or links displayed on such sites. 
You are responsible for and assume all risk arising from your use or 
reliance of any third party sites. Aqita may provide tools 
through the Service that enable you to export information, including without 
limitation Content, to third party services. By using these tools, you agree 
that we may transfer such information to the applicable third-party service. 
Such third party services are not under our control, and we are not 
responsible for their use of your exported information. 
CHANGES TO THE TERMS 
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the Terms on a 
going-forward basis at any time. Please check the Terms periodically for 
changes. In the event that a change to the Terms materially modifies your 
rights or obligations, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such 
change. We may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the 
Service, by sending an email to any address you may have used to register 
for an Account, or through other similar mechanisms. Additionally, if the 
changed Terms materially modify your rights or obligations, we may require 
you to provide consent by accepting the changed Terms. If we require your 
acceptance of the changed Terms, changes are effective only after your 
acceptance. If you do not accept the changed Terms, we may terminate 
your access to and use of the Service. All other changes are effective upon 
publication of the changed Terms. Disputes arising under the Terms will be 
resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect at the time the dispute 
arose. 
OWNERSHIP 
Our Service (including without limitation the Application(s)) is protected by 
copyright, trademark, and other laws of the INDIA and foreign countries. 
Except as expressly provided in the Terms, we (or our licensors) 
exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Service (including 
without limitation the Application(s)), including all associated intellectual property 
rights. Except as expressly provided in the Terms, you may not make use 
of the Service, and Aqita reserves all rights to the Service. 
You may not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service 
mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying 
the Service (including without limitation the Application(s)). You acknowledge and 
agree that any feedback, comments or suggestions you may provide 
regarding the Service (including without limitation the Application(s)) (“Feedback”) 
will be the sole and exclusive property of Aqita and you 
hereby irrevocably assign to us all of your right, title and interest in and to 
all Feedback. 
TERMINATION 
If you breach any of the provisions of the Terms, your permission to use the 
Service will terminate automatically. Additionally, we have the right in our 
sole discretion to suspend or disable your access to or use of the Application(s) 
and/or Service or to terminate your Account and the Terms at any time, 
with or without notice. You may terminate the Terms at any time, with or 
without notice, by deleting your Account and discontinuing all access to and 
use of the Service. If you or we terminate or delete your Account or 
terminate the Terms, you will promptly remove all copies of the Application and 
parts thereof from your possession and control. Upon termination of the 
Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will 
survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, this 
sentence and the following provisions: the last paragraph of “Use of the 
Service,” as well as “Payment,” “Privacy Policy” (for information provided 
during the duration of the Terms), the license you grant in “Content 
Submissions,” “Copyright Policy,” “Indemnity,” “Links to Third Party Sites,” 
“Ownership,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Exclusions,” “General,” “Dispute 
Resolution and Arbitration,” and “Special Terms Regarding Apple.” 
DISCLAIMER 
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT SERVICE (INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CONTENT OR MATERIALS OFFERED 
THROUGH THE SERVICE) ARE PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS” AND ON 
AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE 
EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, 
IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY 
WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF 
TRADE. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE (INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CONTENT OR MATERIALS OFFERED 
THROUGH THE SERVICE) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE 
AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE BASIS OR BE 
FREE OF ERRORS OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU ASSUME ALL 
RISK FOR ALL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF 
OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
ANY CONTENT OR MATERIALS OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE) 
AND YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER SERVICE USERS. 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND 
UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED. WE WILL NOT 
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER 
INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR 
USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE 
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM 
THE SERVICE); (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD 
PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR 
ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER 
BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, 
WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGE. 
EACH PROVISION OF THE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR 
EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THE 
TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN 
THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND 
INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE TERMS. THE 
LIMITATIONS IN THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION WILL APPLY 
EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 
EXCLUSIONS 
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the 
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, 
so the limitations above may not apply to you. 
GENERAL 
You may not assign or transfer the Terms or your rights hereunder, in 
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written 
consent. We may assign the Terms at any time without notice. Our failure 
to enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not be considered a 
waiver of those rights. If any provision of the Terms is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain 
in effect. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding 
our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might 
have between us regarding the Service. 
DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION 
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Aqita in 
the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Aqita 
agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with the Terms shall 
be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a 
lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or 
jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject 
to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages 
and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes 
includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any 
aspect of the Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, 
misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the 
claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms. YOU 
UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS, 
YOU AND Aqita ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A 
TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. 
CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS 
By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic 
communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please 
read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our 
electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, 
agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you 
electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including 
without limitation that such communications be in writing. 
ADDITIONAL TERMS 
Our goal is to communicate, in a timely and accurate manner, the 
messages that you send to and the responses you receive from Local 
Businesses. However, we have no control over, or responsibility for, the 
quality, suitability, safety, legality or any other aspect of any Aqita or their products or services, including the accuracy or reliability 
of their responses, and we make no representations, warranties or 
guarantees in connection with any of the foregoing. We do not conduct any 
screening or other verification with respect to Aqita, their 
representatives, products, services and responses. You acknowledge sole 
responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your communications and 
other interactions with the Aqita, their representatives, 
products, services and responses, including any information that you 
choose to provide to Aqita and their representatives through 
the Service. You release us and our affiliates (and our respective officers, 
directors, employees, agents and representatives) from any and all claims, 
demands and damages (actual, consequential and otherwise) of every kind 
and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed 
and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute 
between you and any business. If you feel that a response from any 
business is not appropriate, please contact us immediately at support@aqita.in; however, we have no obligation to be involved in resolving 
any dispute between you and a business related to or arising out of the 
Service. 
At Aqita, customers get information either from the stores 
directly (verified stores) or through Aqita support team. If you 
see a verified symbol (blue tick) next to any store, it’s the store directly 
answering your query and in all other cases, it’s via the Aqita 
support team. Before answering any query, the Aqita support 
team calls and confirms with the store about the query asked. All the 
information provided over the platform reflects at that particular time and 
may or may not hold true. All the queries addressed when said via the 
Aqita support team, does not in anyway represent the stores 
or the vendors. 
You agree to be a courteous user of the Service and subject to any 
applicable policies of a business, to abide by and be fully responsible for 
any appointment, reservation, order or similar commitment that you make 
with such business through the Services. In addition, you agree that you 
are solely responsible for identifying, reviewing and understanding the 
applicable policies of any business. 
We don’t have an obligation to monitor, review or edit any messages that 
you may send to businesses or responses that you may receive, but we 
have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure 
your compliance with the Terms, or to comply with applicable law or the 
order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other 
governmental body. We reserve the right, at any time and without prior 
notice, to remove or not transmit any messages or responses that we 
consider, in our sole discretion, to be in violation of the Terms or otherwise 
harmful to the Service. We may set a limit on the number of messages that 
you may send to or responses that you may receive from businesses 
through the Service, at our sole discretion. 
By submitting messages through Aqita in addition to the rights 
that you grant us for any Content that you make available through the  Application, 
you also grant us the perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
royalty-free right and license (with the right to sublicense) to use, modify, 
publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such 
messages, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media 
channels (now known or hereafter developed). 
QUESTIONS & CONTACT INFORMATION
